You can also add auxiliary data (for example, adding spatial boundaries from a 2nd source to categorical place names in a simple 2-column dataset dataset).\n\n\nDetail the types, semantics, and limitations\n\nFor each attribute you plan to use, include a description of the data type(s) and the semantics of the attributes (putting this information in a table in your doc might be good for this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteReminders\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute semantics are the real-world meaning of that attribute. A dataset can have multiple types; which you choose is a design choice.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, mention some limitations of the dataset(s). A limitation is anything about the data that could affect the analysis or conclusions. Examples include:\n\n\n\nSize and Access\n\nDataset too large to store\nCan only be streamed via API\n\n\nCoverage and Granularity\n\nOnly includes one country, platform, or time period\n\nMissing certain populations or categories\nLacks geographic detail\nAggregated at too course resolution for the task\n\n\nMissing or Noisy Values\n\nMany nulls or nans\nInconsistent categories or labels\n\n\nProvenance\n\nUnknown data collection and processing methods\nInsufficient or dubious documentation\n\n\n\nIf you choose from the above list, or find a different limitation, explain how this limitation might affect your user’s ability to complete the task(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningFAQs\n\n\n\n\n What counts as having “access” to the data? \n Can we use multiple datasets?",
